These instances are: Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez was asked what candidate was supported by the Black Eagles in the election and instead explained that the Black Eagles controlled the village and he was campaigning to take back the village; he was asked what event was the most critical or important for him and instead summarized all the events; he was asked to explain a contradiction in his evidence, being that he had testified to moving (\u201cd\u00e9menagement\u201d) to Bogota after the assault in 2014 while his written evidence showed that he already lived in Bogota at the time of the 2014 assaults. Instead of answering the question, Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez explained why he had a US visa, when he visited his family, what threats had been made to his wife, etc. Even for this last issue, I have difficulty in agreeing that the translation may have affected the testimony.

The RPD returned to this topic twice and the Appellant was not able to provide a month or year of the elections. He was not able to provide the names of any other candidates, the name of the mayor of the region in 2014 or how many people were on the council. I also find that it is reasonable that a political operative would know the names of the opposing candidates and the incumbent politicians. The Appellant did not have a response when the RPD member confronted him with information that municipal elections were held in 2015 and 2019, and not in 2014 and 2018 as testified by the Appellant. He could not provide the name of the head of the Conservative party when he joined the party in 2012, although the card indicated a name with the title of \u201cpresident\u201d on the card. These facts are important as the Appellants allege that the assaults and threats from the Black Eagles were a result of their political involvement. If the assaults and threats preceded the period of campaigning for the elections, the link between the threat to the Appellant and their political involvement becomes tenuous.","redacted":"The Appellant testified that the elections were held at the beginning of 2018 but could not recall the month of the regional elections. He later testified that the elections happened around the middle of the year but he was not a candidate for the election himself. This is a key issue as the Appellants\u2019 claim is based on their political involvement.
