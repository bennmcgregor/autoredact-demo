However, I find that the RPD was correct in assigning the affidavit little weight based on the affiant\u2019s failure to refer to the Appellant hiding at his home for over a month. I agree with the RPD that this relates to a core aspect of the claim, namely that the Appellant was in hiding after the September 18, 2016 incident.","language":"en","filename":"TC1-00162 a.docx"}

The RPD properly considered the Appellant\u2019s explanation, which it found to be unreasonable, and noted that the Appellant\u2019s time in hiding and the issuance of the FIR are central to the heart of the claim, namely whether the Appellant is wanted for blasphemy and whether he remained in hiding.
