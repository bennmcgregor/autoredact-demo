The Appellants testified that the King of the clan sent men to demand that the estranged husband become the chief priest. The documentary evidence substantiates that conflict may occur in clans and families where someone has refused a spiritual role. I find that seeking to restore spiritual protection is a strong motivation for the family of the estranged husband to find and coerce the Principal Appellant and her sons. Their traditional belief is that no one may succeed the males of this family in the role of chief priest until they are all dead., Documentary evidence also supports the Appellants\u2019 testimony that the priest role need not be passed to the eldest son., This corroborates a risk to each of the Minor Appellants. The Principal Appellant\u2019s risk arises from her outspoken rejection of the chief priest role for her male family members, which also contravenes the clan\u2019s expectations about a woman\u2019s role in the family., In addition, her refusal aggravates a relationship with her estranged husband\u2019s family that was already fraught with dislike and tension. If the estranged husband were to relocate to the IFA of Ibadan, the risk to the Appellants would be increased by his presence, which might alert clan members to their presence also.","language":"en","filename":"VB9-07332 a.docx"}

According to the new evidence, the uncle is a doctor, a philanthropist, and the founder of a national medical non-profit. He would likely have the means to find this single mother and her sons anywhere in Nigeria because of his connections to the medical profession. I find that even if the Principal Appellant chose to return to general medical practice, her profession would require her to register and to advertise her location. This would expose her to abuse from her in-laws, and her sons to conscription into the chief priest role that they have refused.","language":"en","filename":"VB9-07332 a.docx"}
