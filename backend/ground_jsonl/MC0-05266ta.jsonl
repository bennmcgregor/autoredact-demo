During that interview, he found out that the appeal had not been filed and that he would be removed from Canada. The appellant was detained until February 12, 2020. On February 28, he consulted a new counsel, who submitted an urgent application for an extension of time to file an appeal, along with an appeal, to the RAD Registry. Due to the tight time frame, the RAD did not receive this urgent application until March 3, two business days later. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on April 4, 2020. Owing to administrative errors and difficulties relating to the COVID19 pandemic, it was not until May 11, 2021, that the RAD ruled on and allowed the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time filed on February 28, 2020, on the grounds that the appellant had reasonably explained the delay in filing his appeal, had acted diligently, and had established an arguable appeal alleging the incompetence of his counsel.

{"unredacted":"The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.

The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant\u2019s removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. Jordan was remunerated in this case.

{"unredacted":"The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.

The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant\u2019s removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. Jordan was remunerated in this case.

{"unredacted":"The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.

The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant\u2019s removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. Jordan was remunerated in this case. He was not authorized to act as a paid representative before the RPD. He identified himself to the appellant as Me Jordan (that is, as a lawyer), and his representation was inadequate. For these reasons, I conclude that the proceeding and hearing before the RPD were tainted, resulting in a breach of the principles of natural justice.

{"unredacted":"The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged. I conducted my own analysis of the record applying the correctness standard. In his memorandum, the appellant states that he was represented incompetently and illegally by Mr. Jordan because (a) the latter accepted fees before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) when he had been disbarred, (b) he failed to file a notice of appeal when the appellant instructed him to do so, and (c) he failed to adequately represent the appellant\u2019s case before the RPD. The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant\u2019s removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. Jordan was remunerated in this case. He was not authorized to act as a paid representative before the RPD. He identified himself to the appellant as Me Jordan (that is, as a lawyer), and his representation was inadequate. For these reasons, I conclude that the proceeding and hearing before the RPD were tainted, resulting in a breach of the principles of natural justice. Furthermore, while I consider that a breach of natural justice warranting the RAD\u2019s intervention vitiates both the proceeding before the RPD and its decision, I wish to add that Mr. Jordan\u2019s failures in the RAD record caused significant harm to the appellant.","redacted":"The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged.

The notice of appeal can be filed by sending a form that requires basic information, such as the appellant\u2019s name, date of birth, file number and address, along with counsel\u2019s names and addresses. This step is initially sufficient to preserve the right of appeal of a failed refugee protection claimant before the RPD. Mr. XXXX did not complete or submit this notice, nor did he notify Mr. XXXX XXXX that he did not intend to do so. It should also be noted that, if no notice of appeal has been filed with the RAD, there is no stay of removal; therefore, failed refugee protection claimants before the RPD may be summoned by the CBSA to prepare for departure from Canada. This is precisely what happened to the appellant; on XXXX XXXX, 2020, the appellant was summoned by the CBSA and detained until XXXX XXXX, 2020. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on XXXX XXXX, 2020.
