The RPD concluded that the principal appellant had been personally targeted by Los Zetas. According to the documentary evidence, it is established that Los Zetas members use ground-level informants, monitor social media feeds and accounts, and use mapping software to track authorities. In order to locate people, the members of Los Zetas have developed strategic alliances, including temporary alliances, with criminal groups in other regions. More generally, the cartels use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records and placing GPS trackers on cars. They have the capacity and the necessary resources to track people outside of their area of influence as they have developed alliances with various groups belonging to an extensive network and also use their own tracking methods and corrupt agents. In summary, on a balance of probabilities, I conclude that the appellants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the members of Los Zetas if they moved elsewhere in Mexico.","language":"en","filename":"MC0-03450ta.docx"}
{"unredacted":"Furthermore, in my opinion, the appellants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Mexico. Impunity for human rights abuses remained a problem with extremely low rates of prosecution for all forms of crime. According to the federal government\u2019s statistics agency (INEGI), 94 percent of crimes were either unreported or not investigated. Some police officers, particularly at the state and local level, were involved in kidnapping, extortion, and providing protection for, or acting directly on behalf of, members of organized crime and drug traffickers. Although the national anti-corruption system came into effect in July 2017, pending legislation and delays in making appointments at the federal and state levels have prevented the system from becoming fully operational. According to another source, corruption has been rampant in Mexico for a long time and the country is listed among the most corrupt countries in the world. It ranked as the 95th most corrupt country out of 114 countries evaluated. Endemic violence, coupled with high levels of extortion, are proof of concept that criminal activity in Mexico cannot occur without the complicity of municipal, state or federal authorities and indeed flourishes in this corrupt environment. In light of the evidence before me, I am of the opinion that law enforcement officers and members of organized crime act with complete impunity and in complicity, which rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection in Mexico.","redacted":"Furthermore, in my opinion, the appellants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Mexico.
