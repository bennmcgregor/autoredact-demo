He first explained that he tried to contact the hospital, but that his number has been blocked by all public institutions because of the one of the agents of harm. When asked whether his Canadian phone number was also blocked, he changed his answer and mentioned that he asked relatives to call the hospital for him to obtain the documents. When requested to explain why earlier he stated that no one could help to get documents because they were afraid, he quickly replied that he asked the relatives to call the hospital, but not to go there. I do not find this justification even near convincing. I find this part of the testimony to be untrustworthy and to undermine the overall credibility of the Appellant regarding this event. In light of this analysis, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the November 2016 attack took place as alleged.","redacted":"The uncertainty of the oral evidence is exacerbated by his explanation for not having produced any documentary evidence from the hospital or the police authorities to support his allegation.

I note, in particular, that in his BOC, the Appellant detailed his alleged stay at the hospital at that time as having included a visit of the police officers to take his statement. Justifying his 12 day visit at the hospital, he described in his narrative that he was badly beaten and covered in bruises. Indeed, in light of the sufferings that are attached to this kind of situation, I would expect consistency between his BOC and testimony in this regard.

I find this statement to be inconsistent with a person who would have received death threats. I therefore conclude that the RPD was correct when it drew a negative inference on the Appellant\u2019s credibility following this unexplained omission of including the death threats in his narrative with respect to the November 2016 and June 2017 attacks.","redacted":"I believe that it is through those lenses that one needs to analyse the inconsistency regarding the death threats allegedly uttered by the assailants during the attacks.
