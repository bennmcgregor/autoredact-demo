{"unredacted":"According to one paramount chief, the customary method of solving a land dispute doesn\u2019t differ dramatically from the resolution of other types of conflict, although the features he described resembled arbitration much more than mediation: listening to the two parties, having a type of \u201chearing\u201d with questions and answers, visiting the site of the land dispute, doing an investigation, visiting the town chief and the elders in the area in order to get an explanation, deciding \u201cwho is right and who is wrong\u201d, and then ultimately passing a ruling (Interview: 11.9.15).","redacted":"According to one paramount chief, the customary method of solving a land dispute doesn\u2019t differ dramatically from the resolution of other types of conflict, although the features he described resembled arbitration much more than mediation: listening to the two parties, having a type of \u201chearing\u201d with questions and answers, visiting the site of the land dispute, doing an investigation, visiting the town chief and the elders in the area in order to get an explanation, deciding \u201cwho is right and who is wrong\u201d, and then ultimately passing a ruling (Interview: 11.9.15).","language":"en","filename":"TC0-09304 a.docx"}
{"unredacted":"I understand that the Liberian land property system seems riddled with uncertainty, but I note that the Appellant is aware of the legal processes in place to administer the land, as he explained in his BOC that he assisted his father in surveying the land and selling parts of it. He is therefore in a position to proceed with the valid and legal transfer of the title, as it was aggressively demanded by his cousin. In this perspective, and after having considered the totality of the evidence adduced by the Appellant, including the affidavits of his friends and sister, I consider that he failed to establish that after transferring the land to the agents of harm in a clear and formal manner, he would still be at risk of harm or subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by his family members. Alternatively, it would be expected of him to use the traditional dispute resolution mechanism in place to solve the problem, if he so desires.","redacted":"I understand that the Liberian land property system seems riddled with uncertainty, but I note that the Appellant is aware of the legal processes in place to administer the land, as he explained in his BOC that he assisted his father in surveying the land and selling parts of it.
